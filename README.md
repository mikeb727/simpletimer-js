# simpletimer-js

## Synopsis
**simpletimer-js** is a JavaScript library for displaying timers on a webpage. It was written mainly as an exercise in learning JavaScript syntax and coding practices, but it's still feature-rich and useful in several contexts.

## Features
 - Countdown and stopwatch modes
 - Adjustable seconds precision
 - Timer labels and annotations
 - CSS integration

## Usage
Copy the simpletimer.js file to your working folder, and then include the file in any documents using it:

    <script defer href="simpletimer.js"></script>

Then, define the timers to include in a json file, then call the <code>parseTimers()</code> function either inline or from a separate script, with the given json as an argument.
